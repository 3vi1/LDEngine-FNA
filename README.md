LDEngine
========

LDEngine is a 2D pixelart engine/framework for XNA and [Monogame](https://github.com/mono/monogame). I created it to use in Ludum Dare jams, thus the name. The idea is to provide basic support for all the following stuff, while remaining flexible enough to use for virtually any type of game:

* Nearest-neighbour display scaling
* [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) map support with per-pixel collision detection
* Camera with rotation and zoom
* Timers and Tweening
* Sprite animation
* [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) animation
* Gamestate management using a lightly-modified version of the good old [Game State Management sample](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management)
* Entities and pooling (Work in progress)
* Particles
* Sound effects and music playback (Currently not present)
* Windows, Linux and MacOS support (Work in progress)

There's a mish-mash of code from various sources and I haven't cleaned any of it so don't go expecting consistent code quality here! 

* Nick Gravelyn wrote the Tiled content pipeline lib. Can't find a link to the original code, but I've been using it for years!
* The Spine library comes from the [official spine-runtimes repo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)
* Gamestate Management from the above link

Usage and Contributing
----------------------
You can use my code for anything you like without credit. You may need to take a look at licences for the Gamestate Management sample and the Spine runtimes if you use those.

I'll take a look at any PRs submitted - just remember that the idea is to keep the engine flexible!

Building
--------

(Windows)
Requires:
* VS2012 or 2013 (only tested on 2012 but 2013 should be fine)
* XNA Game Studio - can be installed using the [unofficial installers](http://msxna.codeplex.com/releases)
* Font is included in the dependencies dir.

The engine can be compiled with either the standard XNA libraries or Monogame, simply by swapping out the references. The main game project currently references the supplied Monogame .dll which is a recent build of the WindowsGL port. 

Full support for Mac and Linux will be along shortly. I'm 99% sure it'll run on Linux right now by swapping the dll out for a compiled Monogame Linux dll. I haven't tried building it on Mac yet.

Usage
-----

This engine won't help you make a game - I'm assuming you're here because you have experience with XNA and/or Monogame and making 2D games.

I have provided an ExampleGameplayScreen, which the main Game.cs class loads by default. It shows how to load a map, spawn a "Hero", add particles and use the tweening and timer functions.

In Game.cs you can set which screen to load at startup (I've inlcuded some comments to help with that)

You'll probbaly want to start adding your code to GameplayScreen.cs

Tiled
-----

Tiled maps should load out of the box when compiled using the Tiled pipeline extension. You must ensure your layer data (Map->Map Options->Layer format) is Base64 GZip compressed.

To set up the per-pixel collision detection:
* On each of the tilesheets you want to generate collision data for:
  - Select the first (top-left) tile
  - Right-click -> Tile Properties
  - Add a new property: CollisionSet = True

* Then, for each layer you would like to enable collision data on:
  - Right-click -> Layer Properties
  - Add a new property: Collision = On

Camera
------

The camera is a pretty basic "virtual" camera class. It can be intialised by passing a Tiled Map to the contructor, or by setting a width and height of the boundary. Think of the camera as a rectangle sitting inside another rectangle. The camera has a width, height and position (position is always the center of the camera) and is clamped to the outer boundary.

To move the camera, set the Target and the position will lerp smoothly toward it. If you want to instantly move the camera to a new location, set the Position and the Tartget to the same value.

The camera updates a CameraMatrix, which can be passed into a SpriteBatch to neatly handle scrolling for you. Just make sure you draw all your in-world entities using a spritebatch with CameraMatrix.

You can set Rotation (radians) and Zoom (float scale) for fun! Also, try calling Shake(milliseconds, float amount) to Juice It Up.

Timers
------

Using timers is pretty straightfoward. If you've ever used setInterval or setTimeout in JS, then you're golden.

```C#
TimerController.Instance.Create(name, callback, milliseconds, looping);

// example:
TimerController.Instance.Create("shake", () => camera.Shake(500, 2f), 3000, true);
```

If you do not create a looped timer (looping=true) then the timer will fire once and then be destroyed.

You can use timers as simple fire-and-forgets, or you can assign them to a local variable and then use Pause(), Resume(), Reset() and Kill() to manipulate them.

Tweening
--------

A simple yet powerful tweening engine. Works a little like timers, but the callback function is called every time the tween updates. A tween is simply a way of getting from 0f to 1f (and back again if needed), in a stylish fashion.

```C#
TweenController.Instance.Create(name, tween function, callback, milliseconds, pingpong, looping);

// example:
TweenController.Instance.Create("spintext", TweenFuncs.Linear, (tween) =>
            {
                textRot = MathHelper.TwoPi * tween.Value;
            }, 3000, false, true);
```

A tween that has "pingpong" set will go from 0f to 1f and then back to 0f again. It will do that in the supplied millisecond time (rather than taking 2*milliseconds).

A non-pingponging looped tween will go from 0f to 1f and then reset directly to 0f.

Here are the built-in tweening functions:

* Linear
* QuadraticEaseIn
* QuadraticEaseOut
* QuadraticEaseInOut
* CubicEaseIn
* CubicEaseOut
* CubicEaseInOut
* QuarticEaseIn
* QuarticEaseOut
* QuarticEaseInOut
* QuinticEaseIn
* QuinticEaseOut
* QuinticEaseInOut
* SineEaseIn
* SineEaseOut
* SineEaseInOut
* Bounce
* Elastic

Particles
---------

The particle engine is built to be as flexible as possible. One particle texture "sheet" is used for all particles, and each particle can define its source rectangle from within the particle texture.

Particles have Attack, Life and Decay times and Values. For example, a particle with the following values:

AttackTime = 1000;
LifeTime = 5000;
DecayTime = 1000;

Will spend one second coming into existence, five seconds alive, and then one second disappearing.

During each stage of the particle's life, you can measure how far through it is with the Value vars:

AttackValue
LifeValue
DecayValue

Each stage will take the corresponding amount of time to go from 0f to 1f. The point of this is so that you can use a callback function to control exactly how the particle behaves during each stage of its life:

```C#
public static void FadeInOut(Particle p)
{
    switch (p.State)
    {
        case ParticleState.Attack:
            p.Alpha = p.AttackValue;
            break;
        case ParticleState.Alive:
            p.Alpha = 1f;
            break;
        case ParticleState.Decay:
            p.Alpha = 1f - p.DecayValue;
            break;
    }
}
```

You can create your own Particle Callbacks in the static ParticleFunctions class (ParticleController.cs). Because they're static functions, we're not allocating memory for each particle callback.

To add a particle:

```C#
ParticleController.Instance.Add(Vector2 spawnPos, Vector2 velocity, 
                                double attackTime, double lifeTime, double decayTime, 
                                bool affectedbygravity, bool canCollide, 
                                Rectangle sourcerect, Color col, 
                                Action<Particle> particleFunc, 
                                float startScale, float startRot, 
                                int depth, ParticleBlend blend)

// example:
ParticleController.Instance.Add(new Vector2(17, 40), new Vector2(Helper.RandomFloat(2f), -1.5f),
                                100, 3000, 1000,
                                true, true,
                                new Rectangle(0, 0, 2, 2),
                                new Color(new Vector3(1f, 0f, 0f) * (0.25f + Helper.RandomFloat(0.5f))),
                                ParticleFunctions.FadeInOut,
                                1f, 0f,
                                1, ParticleBlend.Alpha);
```

Phew, that's a lot of parameters! They're mostly straightforward, so I'll explain the ones that need it.

When canCollide is set, it'll make the particle collide with the Tiled map per-pixel collision detection. If you're not using a Tiled map, you could add your own collision routines in ParticleController.Update()

SourceRect is the source rectangle for SpriteDatch.Draw. Add your own particles to particles.png and set the rectangle appropriately.

particleFunc sould be set to one of the static function in ParticleFunctions (or your own).

depth is simply a way of grouping particles so that you can draw them in the right order in your scene. Supply depth when you call ParticleController.Draw() and only the particles with the same value for depth will be drawn.

The ParticleBlend enum sets one of three BlendStates for use when drawing the particle:

 * Alpha - uses BlendState.Alpha. For drawing standard particles.
 * Additive - uses BlanedState.Additive. Useful for drawing smoke/cloud particles
 * Multiplicative - uses a custom 2x multiplicative blend state. See [Shawn Hargreave's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2011/08/01/1401282.aspx) for an example. You can use this mode to do crude lighting effects with particles - see the ExampleGameplayScreen for a couple of uses.
 
More
----

I'm still working on audio and entities/pooling, so I'll write about that here when they're done. The Spine runtimes should all work okay, but you'll need to head over to the Spine site (link at the top) to get more info on their usage. I have used the included code several times in my own projects just fine.
